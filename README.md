# Bokeh Depth Of Field

Implementing Different Algorithms to mimic Bokeh Depth Of Field: A Physical Camera Effect created due to Aperture size and shape

This Project is using [The Forge Rendering API](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge), a cross-platform rendering, and targeted for these devices: PC, Android, macOS, IOS, IPad OS devices.


## Motivation

To mimic the physical camera in real-time in an efficient way to reduce postfx overheads.
